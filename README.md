to compile and run your C# program using Visual Studio, one of the most popular IDEs for .NET development, here's how you can do it step-by-step:

Step 1: Install Visual Studio
Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Visual Studio website. The Community Edition is free for individual developers, open-source projects, educational purposes, and small professional teams.

Step 2: Create a New Project
Open Visual Studio.
Select Create a new project.
In the "Create a new project" window, choose Console App (.NET Core) or Console App (.NET 5/6/7) depending on your target framework and click Next. (You might need to enter "Console App" in the search bar if it's not immediately visible.)
Enter your project name, choose a suitable location for your project, and then click Create.

Step 3: Add Your Code
Add Your Existing Code: If you already have your C# code (like the Program.cs you posted), you can copy and paste it into the Program.cs file in your new project. To do this, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, choose Add > Existing Item, and then select your existing .cs files.
Alternatively, you can directly edit the Program.cs file generated by Visual Studio and replace its content with your code.

Step 4: Build and Run Your Program
Build Your Project: You can build your project by clicking Build > Build Solution in the top menu or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + B.
Run Your Program: After building the project, you can run it by clicking on the green play button at the top or by pressing F5 to start debugging. To run without debugging, press Ctrl + F5.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors during the build, check the Error List window in Visual Studio for detailed information and possible fixes.
Ensure that your project targets the correct version of the .NET framework. You can check and change this by right-clicking on your project in the Solution Explorer, selecting Properties, and then navigating to the Application tab.
